Description
The name of my project is 'Python is a Snake!'

The objective of my project is to create a Snake game that the user can play using keyboard commands
The snake glides accross the grid to eat the red fruit to gain a unit to its body.
The game ends if the user collides with the edge of the grid or with its own snake body.
