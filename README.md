Final project repository for Programming for Digital Arts


The name of my project is RPS Bot.

The objective of my project is to create a program that will play rock paper scissors with the user. 
In doing so, it will prompt the user for an input on what they decide to choose for the match. 
Next, it will say something like "Answer confirmed. Playing now:". 
Then, it will go "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" with time in between each word.
The next text would be "[insert bot name] chose [random choice]! You [win/lose]!
The match would repeat three times. After the third time it will count the wins or losses from the player and bot and determine the victor.
After stating the victor, it will say something like: "Thanks for playing! Want to play again?"
If the user returns yes, it will play again. If the user returns no, then it will say something like, "See you next time!"
