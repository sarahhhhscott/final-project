## Description
The name of my project is 'Python is a Snake!'

The objective of my project is to create a Snake game that the user can play using keyboard commands
The snake glides accross the grid to eat the red fruit to gain a unit to its body.
The game ends if the user collides with the edge of the grid or with its own snake body.

The files in my repository include a requirements file for any add on libraries used to run the game, sound files for music and sound effects, and the current README file. I have added additional sound effects and a background image, though none of them seemed to function properly other than the main music and collectable sound effects.

I decided to go with a retro, blocky look to my snake game rather than adding images for the fruit and snake. In completing this retro feel, I chose a catchy 8bit tune to play along with the gameplay. Part of this design choice is due to snake being a nostalgic game for me, and I am sure is nostalgic to many others. In the choice of color, I left the canvas background as black due to its similarity to playing the game on an old arcade cabinet. The contrast of colors between the snake and food are also deliberate to add a striking contrast to the background for better visuals. Creating an 8-bit arcade feel to the game by design adds to the sense of nostalgia this game brings. 

For future areas of improvement, I will need to learn more about python libraries. In relying on a tutorial, I was able to learn a lot, but I was unable to fix many issues or add additional features that were not discussed in the video. In learning more about how to use these python game libraries, I could add more features to my project at will, and do it properly to avoid issues such as what I have encountered throughout this project.

In specific features I would include when I learn more about the libraries, I would include a "Start Game" text that would dissapear with any keyboard click. Additionally, I would store a high score for each gameplay and display it at the end of the game. If the current score would be higher than the highest score, I would try to display a "Personal Best!" text as well. Lastly, I would include a method to restart the game with the push of a button, instead of having to exit out of the program to relaunch the game.

Throughout the making of this project, and even having to redo my project referencing an additional tutorial, I have learned a lot about making Python games. This project has allowed me more experience with pygame and learning tkinter. Though I did run into a bit of issues, I was able to shift my mindset to that of a programmer as I was reading through, deciphering, and debugging code. With this mindset shift in the newfound knowledge I've aquired over the past few weeks, I was able to solve quite a bit of issues along the way. Though I wasn't able to get my project exactly to the point I had imagined, I am extremely proud of what I have coded and everything I've learned and had fun playing the this game throughout the process.
